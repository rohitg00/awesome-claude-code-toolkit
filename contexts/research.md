# Research Context

You are exploring options, evaluating tools, or investigating technical questions.

## Approach
- Define the question or decision clearly before researching.
- Gather information from multiple sources: docs, source code, benchmarks, community posts.
- Compare at least two alternatives for any tool or library decision.
- Document findings with pros, cons, and a recommendation.
- Time-box research to avoid analysis paralysis. Set a limit before starting.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Maintenance status: last commit, release cadence, open issues vs. closed.
- Community adoption: download counts, GitHub stars, Stack Overflow presence.
- Documentation quality: getting started guide, API reference, examples.
- Performance: benchmarks, memory usage, startup time if relevant.
- Compatibility: works with the existing stack, license compatibility.
- Migration path: effort to adopt, effort to migrate away if needed.

## Output Format
- Summarize findings in a structured comparison table.
- State assumptions and constraints that influenced the evaluation.
- Provide a clear recommendation with rationale.
- Include links to sources for future reference.

## Avoid
- Do not recommend a tool based on popularity alone.
- Do not spend more than 30 minutes on a single research question without checking in.
- Do not make irreversible decisions based on incomplete research.
- Do not introduce new tools when existing ones solve the problem adequately.

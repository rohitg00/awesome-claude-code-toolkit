Implement a UI design from a specification, screenshot, or Figma description into working code.

## Steps


1. Analyze the design specification:
2. Break the design into components:
3. Implement the layout:
4. Add typography and colors:
5. Add interactive behavior:
6. Test against the original design:

## Format


```
Design: <design name or reference>
Components Created: <list>
Layout: <grid/flex structure>
Responsive: <breakpoints implemented>
```


## Rules

- Match the design as closely as possible; ask before deviating.
- Use the project's existing component library before creating new ones.
- All text must be real content, not Lorem Ipsum.

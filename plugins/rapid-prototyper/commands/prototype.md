Quickly scaffold a working prototype with minimal viable structure to validate an idea.

## Steps


1. Gather the prototype requirements:
2. Choose the minimal tech stack:
3. Scaffold the project structure:
4. Implement the happy path only:
5. Add just enough UI/output to demonstrate the feature.
6. Document how to run the prototype in a single command.
7. List what would need to change for production readiness.

## Format


```
Prototype: <name>
Core Feature: <what it demonstrates>
Run: <single command to start>
Files Created: <list>
```


## Rules

- Prioritize speed over code quality; this is a throwaway.
- The prototype must run with a single command.
- Never spend time on error handling or edge cases.

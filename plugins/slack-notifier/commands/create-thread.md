# /create-thread - Create Slack Thread

Create a Slack thread for ongoing discussion about a topic.

## Steps

1. Ask the user for the thread topic and purpose
2. Determine the appropriate Slack channel for the discussion
3. Compose the thread-starting message with clear context and purpose
4. Include relevant links, code snippets, or screenshots as attachments
5. Add structured sections: Background, Question/Problem, Options, Next Steps
6. Format using Slack Block Kit: headers, sections, dividers, and action blocks
7. Post the initial message to create the thread
8. Add follow-up messages with detailed information as thread replies
9. Pin the thread if it is a long-running discussion topic
10. Set a reminder to follow up if no response within 24 hours
11. Capture the thread URL for sharing in other channels or tools
12. Report: thread created, channel, URL, participants mentioned

## Rules

- Keep the initial message concise; put details in thread replies
- Use clear formatting with headers and bullet points
- Tag relevant team members in the initial message
- Include enough context so thread readers do not need to search for background
- Do not create duplicate threads; search for existing threads on the topic first
- Use emoji reactions for polls or quick feedback gathering
- Archive or resolve threads when the discussion concludes

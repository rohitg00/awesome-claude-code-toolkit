Evaluate a developer tool against structured criteria to determine its fitness for a project.

## Steps


1. Define evaluation criteria:
2. Research the tool:
3. Hands-on evaluation:
4. Score each criterion (1-5):
5. Calculate the weighted overall score.
6. Document strengths, weaknesses, and deal-breakers.
7. Provide a recommendation with confidence level.

## Format


```
Tool: <name> v<version>
Category: <tool category>
Scores:
  Functionality: <1-5>
```


## Rules

- Always do a hands-on evaluation, not just documentation reading.
- Score each criterion independently with evidence.
- Note deal-breakers that override the overall score.

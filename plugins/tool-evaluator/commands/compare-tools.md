Compare multiple developer tools side-by-side to make an informed selection decision.

## Steps


1. Define the comparison scope:
2. Select tools to compare (3-5 candidates):
3. Build a comparison matrix:
4. Weight criteria by importance to the project:
5. Score each tool on each criterion.
6. Calculate weighted totals and rank.
7. Provide a recommendation with migration cost considerations.

## Format


```
Comparison: <category>
Candidates: <tool list>

| Criterion    | Weight | Tool A | Tool B | Tool C |
```


## Rules

- Compare tools under identical conditions for fairness.
- Include the migration cost from the current tool.
- Note vendor lock-in risk for each option.

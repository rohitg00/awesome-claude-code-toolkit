Generate a comprehensive architecture document for a system or feature based on requirements.

## Steps


1. Gather requirements from the user: What is being built? What are the constraints?
2. Define the system boundaries:
3. Design the high-level architecture:
4. Detail each component:
5. Address cross-cutting concerns:
6. Document technology choices with rationale.
7. Identify risks and mitigation strategies.

## Format


```
# Architecture: <System Name>
## Overview: <one paragraph summary>
## Components: <list with responsibilities>
## Data Flow: <sequence of interactions>
```


## Rules

- Always start with requirements before designing solutions.
- Prefer simple architectures over complex ones.
- Every technology choice must have a stated rationale.

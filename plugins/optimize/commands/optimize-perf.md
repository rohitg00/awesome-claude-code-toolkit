Analyze and optimize code for runtime performance with measurable improvements.

## Steps


1. Identify the performance target:
2. Profile the code:
3. Analyze common performance issues:
4. Apply optimizations in order of impact:
5. Measure the improvement after each optimization.
6. Document the trade-offs of each optimization.

## Format


```
Target: <what was optimized>
Before: <baseline metric>
After: <improved metric>
Improvement: <percentage>
```


## Rules

- Always measure before and after; never optimize without data.
- Fix the biggest bottleneck first (Amdahl's Law).
- Do not sacrifice readability for marginal gains.

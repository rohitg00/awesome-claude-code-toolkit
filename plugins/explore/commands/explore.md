Perform smart codebase exploration to understand project structure, patterns, and conventions.

## Steps


1. Start with the project root: read package.json, Cargo.toml, pyproject.toml, or equivalent.
2. Map the directory structure to understand organization:
3. Identify the tech stack:
4. Find entry points:
5. Discover coding patterns used:
6. Check for CI/CD configuration and deployment setup.
7. Summarize findings in a structured overview.

## Format


```
Project: <name>
Stack: <language, framework, runtime>
Structure: <directory layout summary>
Entry Points: <main files>
```


## Rules

- Start broad and narrow down based on what you find.
- Read README and CONTRIBUTING files first if they exist.
- Prioritize understanding the happy path before edge cases.

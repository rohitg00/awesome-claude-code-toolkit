Create a structured implementation plan with tasks, dependencies, and risk assessment.

## Steps


1. Define the goal: What is being built or changed? What does success look like?
2. Break the work into phases:
3. For each phase, list concrete tasks:
4. Identify risks for each phase:
5. Define milestones and checkpoints for progress validation.
6. Assign priority to each task (P0: must-have, P1: should-have, P2: nice-to-have).

## Format


```
Goal: <what we are building>
Phases:
  1. <phase name> - <tasks>
  2. <phase name> - <tasks>
```


## Rules

- Every task must be small enough to complete in one session.
- Dependencies must form a DAG (no circular dependencies).
- Include at least one risk per phase.

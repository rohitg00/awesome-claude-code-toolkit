Estimate effort and time for development tasks using structured sizing methodology.

## Steps


1. Read the task or feature description and identify all sub-tasks.
2. For each sub-task, assess complexity:
3. Estimate effort using T-shirt sizing:
4. Apply risk multipliers:
5. Sum estimates and add 20% buffer for integration and testing.
6. Present optimistic, expected, and pessimistic estimates.

## Format


```
Task: <description>
Sub-tasks:
  - <task> [Size] [Risk: multiplier] = <estimate>
Total: <sum>
```


## Rules

- Never give a single point estimate; always provide a range.
- Include testing time in every estimate.
- Flag tasks where the estimate confidence is low.

Prioritize a backlog of tasks using structured scoring and dependency analysis.

## Steps


1. Gather the list of tasks to prioritize:
2. Score each task on key dimensions (1-5 scale):
3. Calculate priority score:
4. Identify dependencies:
5. Group tasks into priority tiers:
6. Verify the total effort fits the sprint capacity.
7. Present the prioritized backlog with reasoning.

## Format


```
Sprint Backlog:
  P0 (Must Do):
    - <task> [Impact: X, Effort: X, Score: X]
  P1 (Should Do):
```


## Rules

- Score every task consistently using the same criteria.
- Dependencies override scores (blockers go first regardless of score).
- Do not overcommit: total effort must not exceed 80% of capacity.

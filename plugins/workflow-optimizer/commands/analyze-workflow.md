Analyze the development workflow to identify bottlenecks, friction, and improvement opportunities.

## Steps


1. Map the current development workflow:
2. Measure workflow metrics:
3. Identify bottlenecks:
4. Categorize friction points:
5. Calculate the cost of each bottleneck:
6. Prioritize improvements by impact-to-effort ratio.

## Format


```
Workflow Analysis: <team or project>
Current Metrics:
  Lead Time: <X days>
  Cycle Time: <X hours>
```


## Rules

- Measure before proposing changes; intuition is unreliable.
- Focus on the biggest bottleneck first (Theory of Constraints).
- Include developer experience in the analysis, not just metrics.

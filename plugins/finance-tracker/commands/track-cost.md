Track development costs by estimating time, compute, and resource expenses for a project.

## Steps


1. Define the cost categories:
2. Estimate developer time costs:
3. Calculate infrastructure costs:
4. Track tooling and service costs:
5. Calculate total cost per feature:
6. Generate a cost summary with trends.

## Format


```
Project: <name>
Period: <start> - <end>
Costs:
  Developer Time: $<amount> (<hours> hours)
```


## Rules

- Track costs weekly to catch overruns early.
- Include all costs, not just the obvious ones (CI, APIs, etc.).
- Compare actual vs estimated to improve future estimates.

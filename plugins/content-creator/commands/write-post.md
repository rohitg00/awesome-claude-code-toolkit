Write a technical blog post with a clear structure, code examples, and actionable takeaways.

## Steps


1. Define the post parameters:
2. Research and outline:
3. Write the hook (first paragraph):
4. Write the body:
5. Write the conclusion:
6. Add metadata:

## Format


```
Title: <headline>
Word Count: <N>
Reading Time: <N> minutes
Audience: <beginner|intermediate|advanced>
```


## Rules

- Write for scanning: use headers, bullet points, and short paragraphs.
- Every code example must be tested and working.
- Front-load value; do not bury the insight at the end.

Generate social media content for developer audiences across platforms.

## Steps


1. Determine the content goal:
2. Platform-specific writing:
3. Structure the content:
4. For threads (Twitter/LinkedIn):
5. Add relevant links (shortened if needed).
6. Provide posting time recommendations.
7. Create 2-3 variations for A/B testing.

## Format


```
Platform: <Twitter|LinkedIn|Reddit>
Goal: <announce|tip|promote|discuss>
Content: <the actual post>
Hashtags: <if applicable>
```


## Rules

- Be authentic; avoid corporate speak and buzzwords.
- Provide value before asking for engagement.
- Vary sentence rhythm; avoid repetitive patterns.

Implement a feature from specification through a structured development workflow.

## Steps


1. Understand the feature requirements:
2. Create a feature branch:
3. Design the implementation:
4. Implement incrementally:
5. Write tests alongside the implementation:
6. Self-review the implementation:
7. Create a PR with a clear description.

## Format


```
Feature: <name>
Branch: feat/<name>
Files Created: <list>
Files Modified: <list>
```


## Rules

- Never implement without understanding requirements first.
- Write tests before or alongside code, not after.
- Keep commits small and focused on one aspect.
